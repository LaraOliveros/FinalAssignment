					 <h2 class="Header2"><strong> About Me </strong></h2>
					 <p>Hello there! My name is <b>Lara!</b></p>
					 <p>I am currently <b>23</b> years YOUNG. My birthday is on March 10, 1995. I was born in the Philippines and moved to Canada when I was only 4 years old. I am VERY short. My family consists of my dad, my mom, my two older sisters, my brother, and my doggy, Timbit! I have been living in Mississauga my entire life and I LOVE it. I am a FOURTH year (yay) Brock University student majoring in <b>Medical Science</b> - it's hard, I don't recommend it. However, since going to Brock Univiersity, I have been living in St. Catharines during the school year (and I hate it), but I do go back to my happy place every weekend and during the summer! I spend the majority of my summers working at a medical company, <b>Mui Scientific</b>. I hope that in the near future, I could take everything I have learned from working there and move on to <span class="bigText"><b>bigger</b></span> and <span class="bigText"><b>better</b></span> things! (fingers crossed!)</p>
					 <p>Three things I enjoy doing most include: shopping, (indoor) rock climbing, and watching Youtube videos. Some Youtubers I enjoy watching include: <b>Zoella</b>, <b>ACE Family</b>, <b>JK Party</b>, and many more. You should definitely check them out as well on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>!</p>

			 <h2 class="Header2"><strong> Seven Inspiring Quotes I Live By </strong></h2>
			 <ol>
 				<li> <em>"The journey is never ending. There's always gonna be growth, improvement, adversity; you just gotta take it all in and do what's right, continue to grow, continue to live in the moment."</em> - <b>Antonio Brown</b></li>
 				<li> <em>"Life is not always easy to live, but the opportunity to do so is a blessing beyond comprehension. In the process of living, we will face struggles, many of which will cause us to suffer and to experience pain."</em> - <b>L. Lionel Kendrick</b></li>
				<li> <em>"The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant."</em> – <b>Doctor Who</b></li>
				<li> <em>"The biggest risk is not taking any risk…. In a world that’s changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks."</em> — <b>Mark Zuckerberg</b></li>
				<li> <em>"Don’t allow your past or present condition to control you. It’s just a process that you’re going through to get you to the next level."</em> — <b>T.D. Jakes</b></li>
				<li> <em>"I’m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can’t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my best."</em> - <b>Marilyn Monroe</b></li>
				<li> <em>"When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us."</em> - <b>Helen Keller</b></li>
